Create a DataFrame object using feature extraction algorithm
Naming convention:

Type1 matrix: dm_xyz where xyz is the sensor (eg:ZnO blah blah) xyz is to be accepted as a user input
Type2 matrix: dm_abc where abc is the feature where abc is to be accepted as a user input

Type1 matrix: column headers:[signal_no, features], this is for xyz sensor.
Type2 matrix: column headers:[ZnO, ZnO2, etc], this is for abc feature.

Nothing should be imported as feature_extraction is in the same working directory.
